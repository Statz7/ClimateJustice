    <h4>Making a Change</h4>
    <p class="indent">In order to help push for climate justice, there are many different actions we can take. First, it is important to be educated on climate justice and how it effects the communities around the world. This can be as easy as clicking here to go back to the home page to learn more about climate change and climate justice. 
      While that is a good start, you should also do your own research to further your understanding of climate justice and look into the effects of environmental racism. Another way we can help fight for climate justice is to make the voices of the communities effected heard. 
      This could involve listening to those who are experiencing the effects of environmental racism firsthand, supporting climate justice efforts by participating in public events that help to advocate for change in how climate justice is being addressed, or the lack thereof. 
      Spending money at places where you agree with their environmental practices is another way to help push for climate justice. Opposed to relying on the traditional big companies that often harm the environment, decreasing the quality of life for the people in that area, we can look at a companyâ€™s policies and practices, and support the businesses that align with our values. 
      Finally, you can vote to put officials in place who support environmental equality, advocate to combat climate change, etc. This will put people in positions of power who will fight for climate justice and an overall healthier environment for all of us.</p>
