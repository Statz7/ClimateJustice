            <h4>Climate Justice Starts with Climate Change</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="indent">Greenhouse gas levels are extermely high. the levels Notibly the most harmful of the greenhouse gasses, carbondioxide levels in the atmosphere are at an all time high. Greenhouse gases are causing drastic changes in our Earth’s Climate. 
                Increases in wildfires, droughts, and excessive rainfall are causing an irrivirsible damage to people and their communities. Air pollution due to greenhouse gasses and the burning of fosil fuels has caused many people to have respitory diseases or worsen existing ones. 
                Wildfires are as much of a problem as we are losing even more of our forrests to wildfires, and communities are often directly effected as well. 
                Droughts contribute to the amount of wildfires as well since wildfires often occur in dry conditions. Droughts also effect communities causing a shortage of water or water restrictions, which can have devestating effects on people’s lives.
                Finally, excessive rainfall (i.e. hurricanes, floods) can destory entire cities, damage homes, and ruin crops. After one of these events, it takes a lot of time, effort, and money to rebuild what was destroyed. It can take much longer to rebuild that feeling of safety and togetherness within the effected community.</p>

          <h4>Climate Justice - Why Act?</h4>
          <p class="indent">To understand Climate Justice is to understand that Climate Change has differing effects on different groups of people. For example, poorer communities will suffer because of air pollution near their homes. A 1950’s study showed that the federal government habitually placed hazardous waste zones within African American societies. This allowed the fight for climate justice to gain traction with the study proving that private companies and the government were profiting off polluting these vulnerable communities. The richest 10% of the population is responsible for over 90% of all CO2 emissions, and these large amounts of CO2 being released into the air results in the surrounding area’s quality of air to be reduced. This leads to increased respiratory diseases in these communities near these high levels of CO2 emissions. Another reason Climate Justice is so important is due to the effect droughts have on highly populated areas. While people in lower to moderate density communities may still have the ability to use water in a drought as they always would.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <p class="indent">This is not the case for all higher density living areas, as they may fall under water usage restrictions to ensure the entire community is able to live relatively comfortably. Climate Justice also involves allowing all people to have the ability to avoid harsh temperatures in their homes. Older buildings, highly populated areas, and extreme conditions can lead to widespread harm such as extreme exposure to the cold when there is a failure to supply residents with heat, such as the recent events in Texas, or extreme heat within a home when there is a failure to supply cooling for many residents. 
        Climate Justice does not only effect those who live in certain areas as language barriers can cause people to be informed about possible extreme weather later than the rest of their community. This can lead to danger of not evacuating in time, a lack of supplies being available at supermarkets, and a lack of knowledge on dangerous conditions in an area. 
        Climate change is continuing to get worse with time. The future generations will feel the effects of climate change much more than we are now. With different groups of people already being set behind because of their wealth, living situation, or culture is already putting people at risk, and it will only continue to get worse without action.
